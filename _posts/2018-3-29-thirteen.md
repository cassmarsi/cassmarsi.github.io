## Introduction

[Ottawa Love Stories](https://ottlovestories.wordpress.com) is growing. Just over a month ago, all the pieces of this digital adventure finally came together and I started experimenting with where it could go. But it all really began with our first class discussion, and that very crucial question that has inspired my thinking of my work in general since then: what if the public is just one person? As a public historian, what does it mean to create for, or with, or by thinking of just one person? 

When talking to people about this project, I've often been faced with having to explain what public history is. And I always start by saying if you ask six public historians to define public history, you'll get six different answers. Over the last few years, I've had so many conversations - - sometimes in circles - - about what public history is or isn't. The quick and easy response is the whole "history by the people for the people" thing, but it doesn't quite cut it when you think of other spheres in which public history operates: national museums, commemorations, government... I usually then explain that it's history done outside of or in collaboration with people, communities, organizations outside of academia. But my answer - always - refers to a collective. It took this class to turn that definition of public history on it's head.

> "...no matter whether the PT is aimed at one person or many, no matter whether it is “signed”
or anonymous, if it does not change someone’s life (aside from the artist) it fails." Hakim Bey, page 10 of *T.A.Z.: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism*

Suddenly, I realized that my project didn't have to change live**s**. And, in fact, by thinking that way, I was discounting all the little, hidden, subtle ways we can connect with an individual person. It seems only fitting now, looking back, that the stories I would choose to tell would be ones of love; relationships that blossom from the little, hidden, the subtle actions and interactions between individuals. I could say this was intentional, but truthfully it wasn't. In fact, the realization that I wanted to work with love stories came about in probably the most typical way (for a historian): through a search in the archives. Browsing through newspapers from early and mid-twentieth century Ottawa, I started looking for interesting personal stories to start plotting on a map. These searches left me uninspired until, one class, I decided - for some reason - to type: "love story" into the search bar. After another unsuccessful browse through personals and advice columns, I turned to Google in exasperation.

At this point, I knew I wanted to work with sound and mapping. This, stemming from [reflection](https://cassmarsi.github.io/two/) after [reflection](https://cassmarsi.github.io/four/) after [reflection](https://cassmarsi.github.io/five/) on the kind of feelings I wanted my project to inspire in individual participants. And it was only after these weeks of reflection, that I finally found [Patricia and Bud's](http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/its-a-love-story-inseparable-for-51-years-ottawa-husband-and-wife-die-hours-apart) story. What caught my attention about the story-telling in this article was the decision to move the story forward through the significant locations of their life together, in Ottawa.

**Where do Ottawa's love stories take place? What do they *sound* like?** Those are the questions I ask as I map and sonify the stories people have so generously chosen to share with me. Ottawa Love Stories is a community, but it’s about that individual experience of sharing your story, listening to it, or listening to other stories. It’s about the past, the present, and sometimes even the future. It’s about people, friendship, relationships, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, disappointment… love. It’s about the unique, it’s about choices, it’s about walking, hearing, knowing Ottawa differently. It’s creating a new history of the buildings, streets, and sidewalks we cross every day. And it's about changing our individual relationships with these spaces and their history. It’s a collaboration.

## History without words

[Words](https://cassmarsi.github.io/one/) make our thoughts tangible, words make our ideas known. Words make us vulnerable. We count our words to make sure we've stayed within the acceptable limits. We calculate them, trying different combinations and intonations, favouring the poetic or the authoritative or the methaphorical depending on the stories we perform. We weigh words, choosing carefully between this or that; even the most subtle of variation in connotation is considered.
