There's been a lot to think about these last few weeks. It's been exciting starting from basically zero to simply being able to write this post on this blog right now. I mean, ya I used to edit my own MySpace code - though I'm very far from the once super cool pre-teen I was in high school - and I've even worked with Arduino in the past. But, I still feel like an outsider in this world. And it's still a little scary for me, to be honest. I don't know the language, and I don't know the community, and imposter syndrome has never been so real.

#### But the clock is ticking.
I've been thinking about what kind of project I'd like to attempt within the scope of this course, and I still don't really know. I'm not sure what I want to say or break or work through. I have until Thursday to come up with at least the platform I want to be working on. So, in the next few days, I'm going to figure this out -- at least, for now. And I'll do this in a way that's comfortable to me, familiar. Like when I stay up with my sketchbook, drawing, collaging, watercolouring, embroidering -- this is the same. This is about process. Trying, failing, sweating, swearing, losing everything, starting over. I know this world. And, for me, it all starts with words.

It was interesting that we kept coming back to text in our conversation and in our ideas. Maybe Dumbledore was right, words are our most inexhaustible source of magic. Words are powerful --

-- Even Bey's own words provoked this emotion in us at times. Just words.
