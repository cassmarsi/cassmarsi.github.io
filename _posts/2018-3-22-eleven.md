I knew deep down that I always wanted this project to be interactive, and that, for me, meant getting out of the online newspaper archives. I wasn't really inspired by anything I found on there, but I was excited about having the opportunity to interact with people about their past and present and passed down love stories. So I made the project website and shared it on my social media (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram). While I got lots of support and positive feedback, I didn't really get any submissions, which was really frustrating. After a week or two of nothing, I posted about the project on a Facebook group (Bunz) late at night, hoping to finally get some submissions but really only expecting to get a couple of responses. The next day, I realised that the Bunz post had exploded. It had over 100 likes and 20 comments; I already had a handful of messages and they kept coming in through the project email and messenger.
