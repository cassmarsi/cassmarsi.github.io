### why sound?
#### it screws with time

>"I want to hear the meaning of the past, but I know that I can’t. Nevertheless, when I hear an instrument, I can imagine the physicality of the player playing it; in its echoes and resonances I can discern the physical space. I can feel the bass; I can move to the rhythm. The music engages my whole body, my whole imagination. Its associations with sounds, music, and tones I’ve heard before **create a deep temporal experience, a system of embodied relationships between myself and the past**." [Shawn Graham](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sonification)

>"We can zoom into an image, but we can't do that with sound." [Robert Kosara](https://eagereyes.org/techniques/sonification-the-power-the-problems)

We zoom in to see details, to make something clearer, or to be sure of something. Sound takes that immediate ability away

- making data unfamiliar again
- 'auditory hallucination': "This example shows how in any representation of data we can hear/see what is not, strictly speaking, there. We fill the holes with our own expectations."

  - "celebrates DIY practices, reveals a deep commitment to place, embraces destruction as a creative process, and is a form of spontaneous expression"

  - "How can audiovisual tools be used to transform, create, expand, **amplify** and interpret physical spaces?"

>"I want to explore and interact with the environment using audiovisual media, to create a poetics of everyday life. This is partly inspired by ideas of the embodied mind from cognitive science, ideas from psychogeography about the individual's relation to its environment, and expanded cinema."

### "To move in space and to organise in space is a way to think, dream and remember."

- Looking at the time/space relationship:

>"[...] a space is a combination of being a specific location at a specific time. I want to explore this relationship on many levels: The relation between the memory/past of a space and the present (psychometric architecture), resolution of space and time (compressing/stretching time, looking at the surroundings through a microscope), breaking up the linear relation of space/time through animation, timelapse, reshuffling of frames, layers of time in a single image etc."
