### why sound?
#### it screws with time

>"I want to hear the meaning of the past, but I know that I can’t. Nevertheless, when I hear an instrument, I can imagine the physicality of the player playing it; in its echoes and resonances I can discern the physical space. I can feel the bass; I can move to the rhythm. The music engages my whole body, my whole imagination. Its associations with sounds, music, and tones I’ve heard before **create a deep temporal experience, a system of embodied relationships between myself and the past**." [Shawn Graham](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sonification)

Though it's hard to explain, I want to work with sound because I feel like it will best embody the type of *feeling(s)* I want my project to create. I like that the same sound can conjure up different memories/images/sensations. I like that sounds can sound nostalgic, or futuristic, or otherworldly. And I like what sounds can make you feel (physically, psychologically, imaginarily).

>"We can zoom into an image, but we can't do that with sound." [Robert Kosara](https://eagereyes.org/techniques/sonification-the-power-the-problems)

We zoom in to see details, to make something clearer, or to be sure of something. Sound takes that immediate ability away. What happens when a sound isn't what you think it is, but you'll never know?

- making data unfamiliar again
- 'auditory hallucination': "This example shows how in any representation of data we can hear/see what is not, strictly speaking, there. We fill the holes with our own expectations."

I'm still not sure what exactly what I want my project to say or be about. But these are the things (above and below) I'm thinking about, reading, and reflecting on.

to do:
- tutorials [here](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sonification)
- read up on [recho](http://recho.org/) - - sadly only available in the US app store

research:
- [Pembroke Soundscapes](http://pembrokesoundscapes.ca/)
  - "**What is sound?** This may be a strange question to ask. After all, sound is all around us. We know it intuitively. Sound is noise is sound is noise is sound... It is a phenomenon resulting from the movement of objects; sound is vibration; it is a wave. We have an intuitive understanding of sound, often invoking some sort of scientific explanation."
  - It's an experience
  - The [project reflection](https://rblades.gitbooks.io/pembroke-soundscapes/content/chapter1.html) is a really interesting read

  - "celebrates DIY practices, reveals a deep commitment to place, embraces destruction as a creative process, and is a form of spontaneous expression"
- [Conversations with Spaces](https://hcgilje.wordpress.com/about/) by HC Gilje
  - "How can audiovisual tools be used to transform, create, expand, **amplify** and interpret physical spaces?"

>"I want to explore and interact with the environment using audiovisual media, to create a poetics of everyday life. This is partly inspired by ideas of the embodied mind from cognitive science, ideas from psychogeography about the individual's relation to its environment, and expanded cinema."

  - "To move in space and to organise in space is a way to think, dream and remember."

  - Looking at the time/space relationship:

>"[...] a space is a combination of being a specific location at a specific time. I want to explore this relationship on many levels: The relation between the memory/past of a space and the present (psychometric architecture), resolution of space and time (compressing/stretching time, looking at the surroundings through a microscope), breaking up the linear relation of space/time through animation, timelapse, reshuffling of frames, layers of time in a single image etc."

- [Soundscapes: A Historical Approach](http://www.sonoscop.net/sonoscop/soundscape/igese.html) by José Iges

>"The soundscape presents us with a falsehood, or perhaps with an impossibility: it proposes an equivalence between the sounds of an environment, of a real given space, and these sounds once recorded and organised in the space of a sound work on a mono, stereo or multichannel support. If we do not accept this convention, the sounds of a soundscape cannot be seen to represent this basic acoustic reality."

  - Not really the best examples of great soundscape work, but interesting nonetheless
  - While listening to the one on Ava Gardner, the song "L-O-V-E" started playing to represent her relationship with Frank Sinatra. But of course, all I could think about was "The Parent Trap"
