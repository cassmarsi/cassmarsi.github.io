As I've been moving forward on my mapping project, I've also been working on figuring out how to use Arduino again. Since I've last used it four or five years ago, a lot has changed. Mainly, there's now a whole editor [online](https://create.arduino.cc/editor), whereas before, I had to actually download the software, which would basically just open up a text box in which you could write your code. Speaking of the code - - I finally found it. It's been quite frustrating, especially since it's been right on my computer the entire time. Anyway, I first thought that it was uploaded onto the SD card, which it wasn't: that just held the three sound clips that the sensors would trigger. I then remembered that it was actually on the Arduino shield itself. So, I didn't actually need the SD card reader, I needed a USB 2.0. I got one, I hooked it all up, opened the Arduino create interface and immediately erased everything that was on my shield by uploading the empty code onto it while I though I was downloading my code into the workspace. 10/10 me!

I then did what I probably should have done a month ago, and checked in my folder for my class at the time. And there it was.

        SdFat sd;
        SFEMP3Shield MP3player;
        int tilt_s1 = 2;
        int tilt_s2 = 3;
        int ledPin = 13; // choose the pin for the LED
        int inPin = 7;   // choose the input pin (for a pushbutton)
        int val = 0;     // variable for reading the pin status
        int tmp102Address = 0x48;

        void setup() {

        Serial.begin(9600);
  
        pinMode(tilt_s1, INPUT);
        pinMode(tilt_s2, INPUT);
        Serial.begin(9600);
 
        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // declare LED as output
        pinMode(inPin, INPUT);    // declare pushbutton as input
  
        Serial.begin(9600);
        Wire.begin();

        //start the shield
        sd.begin(SD_SEL, SPI_HALF_SPEED);
        MP3player.begin();

        //motion sensor
        //start playing track 000
        MP3player.playTrack(000);
        }

        int getTiltPosition(){
        int s1 = digitalRead(tilt_s1);
        int s2 = digitalRead(tilt_s2);
        return (s1 << 1) | s2; //bitwise math to combine the values
        }
  
        //do something else now
        void loop() {

        Serial.println("I'm bored!");
        delay(2000);
  
        int position = getTiltPosition();
        Serial.println(position);
        delay(200); //only here to slow down the serial output
  
        val = digitalRead(inPin);  // read input value
        if (val == HIGH) {         // check if the input is HIGH (button released)
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // turn LED OFF
        } else {
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  // turn LED ON
        }
 
        float celsius = getTemperature();
        Serial.print("Celsius: ");
        Serial.println(celsius);

        float fahrenheit = (1.8 * celsius) + 32;  
        Serial.print("Fahrenheit: ");
        Serial.println(fahrenheit);

        delay(200); //just here to slow down the output. You can remove this
  

        //soft switch
        //start playing track 001
        MP3player.playTrack(001);

 
        //temp sensor
        //start playing track 002
        MP3player.playTrack(002);
 

        }

  

        float getTemperature(){
        Wire.requestFrom(tmp102Address,2); 

        byte MSB = Wire.read();
        byte LSB = Wire.read();

        //it's a 12bit int, using two's compliment for negative
        int TemperatureSum = ((MSB << 8) | LSB) >> 4; 

        float celsius = TemperatureSum*0.0625;
        return celsius;
        }

Now, just looking at it, I don't remember what any of this means together. In bits, it makes sense. I think. It's interesting, as we've talked about before, the sheer number of documents and links and codes and parts of codes that are leftover from this project: working digitally creates lots of **stuff**. And it's quite overwhelming. In fact, doing this has been as much making an archive as trying to understand my archive from 5 years ago. Whatever logic I implemented then, just doesn't make sense to me now even though it's on the same computer, done by the same person, in a similar folder/file system I continue to use today. And I'm realizing more and more that recreating, digitally, is not just a matter of copy-paste.
